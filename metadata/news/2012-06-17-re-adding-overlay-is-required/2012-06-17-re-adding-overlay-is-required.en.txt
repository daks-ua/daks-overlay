This overlay has been added to the global list of overlays,
accessible via layman. Everyone who added it by editing
/etc/layman/layman.cfg please comment out added lines,
remove the overlay and add again:

# sed -e "s:^[ \t]*http\://iglast.kh.ua/daks.hg.xml:# http\://iglast.kh.ua/daks.hg.xml:" \
-i /etc/layman/layman.cfg
# layman -d daks
# layman -a daks

After about two weeks http://iglast.kh.ua/daks.hg.xml file
may become unavailable due to circumstances beyond of my control,
so the overlay will stop working.
